   - Develop cross-agent recommendations

3. **Final Testing and Deployment**
   - Comprehensive testing of all agents
   - Performance optimization
   - Production deployment preparation

## Development Approach

### Code Reuse Strategy

1. **Shared Components Utilization**
   - Both agents will leverage the shared market data processor
   - Memory systems will be reused across agents
   - Configuration management will follow the established pattern

2. **Agent-Specific Extensions**
   - Each agent will extend base classes with specialized functionality
   - Agent-specific modules will be isolated in their respective directories
   - Clear interfaces will be maintained for future extensibility

### Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Testing**
   - Each module will have comprehensive unit tests
   - Shared components will have extensive test coverage
   - Agent-specific extensions will be tested independently

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Cross-module integration will be tested
   - Agent-level integration tests will verify end-to-end functionality
   - Cross-agent integration will be tested where applicable

3. **Validation Testing**
   - Each agent will have validation scripts similar to TAAT
   - External dependencies will be mocked for testing
   - Performance benchmarks will be established

### Documentation Strategy

1. **Code Documentation**
   - All modules will have comprehensive docstrings
   - Complex algorithms will have detailed explanations
   - Examples will be provided for key functionality

2. **Architecture Documentation**
   - Each agent will have architecture documentation
   - Integration points will be clearly documented
   - Deployment configurations will be documented

3. **User Documentation**
   - Each agent will have user guides
   - API documentation will be provided
   - Example usage scenarios will be documented

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Technical Risks**
   - IBKR API integration complexity: Mitigated by creating a robust abstraction layer
   - Options pricing accuracy: Mitigated by implementing multiple pricing models
   - Performance bottlenecks: Mitigated by early performance testing

2. **Schedule Risks**
   - Dependency delays: Mitigated by prioritizing shared components
   - Scope creep: Mitigated by clear feature prioritization
   - Integration challenges: Mitigated by continuous integration testing

## Success Metrics

1. **Development Metrics**
   - Code coverage: Target >80% for all modules
   - Build success rate: Target >95% for CI/CD pipelines
   - Documentation completeness: All public APIs documented

2. **Functional Metrics**
   - ALL-USE: Successful execution of options strategies
   - MENTOR: Accurate alignment of recommendations with user philosophy
   - Cross-agent: Seamless integration between agents

3. **Performance Metrics**
   - Response time: <500ms for user interactions
   - Throughput: Support for multiple concurrent users
   - Resource utilization: Efficient CPU and memory usage
