# TAAT WS-2 Phase 1: Memory Systems Implementation Prompt

## Overview

This document provides the implementation prompt for Phase 1 of Workstream 2 (WS-2) for the TAAT agent. In this phase, we will focus on implementing the core memory systems required for TAAT's cognitive framework.

## Objectives

1. Implement a comprehensive memory architecture for TAAT that includes:
   - Episodic memory for storing temporal sequences of events and experiences
   - Semantic memory for storing knowledge, concepts, and relationships
   - Procedural memory for storing action sequences and trading procedures
   - Working memory for managing active context

2. Create a unified memory manager that coordinates between different memory systems

3. Integrate the memory systems with the agent's perception-cognition-action loop

## Requirements

### Episodic Memory

Implement an episodic memory system that:
- Stores temporal events with timestamps and metadata
- Supports retrieval by ID, type, timeframe, and content
- Provides persistence to disk for long-term storage
- Enables chronological ordering and recency-based filtering

### Semantic Memory

Implement a semantic memory system that:
- Stores concepts with categories and metadata
- Supports relationship mapping between concepts
- Enables search by content and category
- Provides persistence to disk for long-term storage

### Procedural Memory

Implement a procedural memory system that:
- Stores action sequences and procedures
- Supports execution of stored procedures with parameter passing
- Enables learning and adaptation of procedures based on outcomes
- Provides versioning and rollback capabilities
- Ensures persistence to disk for long-term storage

### Memory Manager

Implement a memory manager that:
- Provides a unified interface for all memory systems
- Supports cross-memory queries and operations
- Integrates with the perception-cognition-action loop

### Integration

Update the agent's perception-cognition-action loop to:
- Store experiences in episodic memory during perception
- Retrieve relevant knowledge from all memory systems during cognition
- Execute procedures from procedural memory during action
- Learn from outcomes to update procedural memory

## Deliverables

1. Implementation of episodic, semantic, and procedural memory systems
2. Implementation of a unified memory manager
3. Integration with the agent's perception-cognition-action loop
4. Comprehensive tests for all memory systems
5. Detailed documentation of the memory architecture and usage

## Evaluation Criteria

The implementation will be evaluated based on:
- Functionality: All memory systems work as specified
- Integration: Memory systems are properly integrated with the agent loop
- Robustness: Memory systems handle edge cases and errors gracefully
- Persistence: Memory systems properly save and load data
- Documentation: Implementation is well-documented and easy to understand

## Implementation Approach

1. Review existing memory-related code in the monorepo
2. Design the memory systems architecture
3. Implement the procedural memory system (episodic and semantic already exist)
4. Implement the memory manager
5. Update the agent's perception-cognition-action loop
6. Write tests for all memory systems
7. Document the implementation and usage

## Timeline

This phase should be completed within 5-7 days, with the following milestones:
- Day 1-2: Architecture design and review
- Day 3-4: Implementation of procedural memory and memory manager
- Day 5: Integration with agent loop
- Day 6: Testing and validation
- Day 7: Documentation and finalization

## Resources

- Existing episodic memory implementation: `src/memory_systems/episodic.py`
- Existing semantic memory implementation: `src/memory_systems/semantic.py`
- Working memory implementation: `src/agent_core/memory/memory.py`
- Base agent implementation: `src/agent_core/agent.py`
- TAAT agent implementation: `src/agents/taat/agent.py`

## Constraints

- All memory systems must be compatible with the existing agent architecture
- Memory persistence should be configurable (in-memory or disk-based)
- Implementation should be thread-safe for future multi-threading support
- Code should follow the project's style and documentation standards

## Next Steps

After completing this phase, we will proceed to Phase 2 of WS-2, which will focus on advanced memory retrieval and integration mechanisms.
