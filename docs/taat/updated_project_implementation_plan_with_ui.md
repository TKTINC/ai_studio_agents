# TAAT Agent Project Implementation Plan (Updated with UI Development Track)

## 1. Executive Summary

This updated Project Implementation Plan outlines the approach for developing TAAT (Twitter Trade Announcer Tool) as an AI Agent rather than a traditional application. Using the agent-oriented iAI Framework, TAAT will be built as an autonomous entity with perception, cognition, and action capabilities that can monitor trader posts on X (Twitter), identify trade signals, make trading decisions, and execute trades with appropriate human collaboration.

The implementation follows a structured approach with 7 workstreams (including a new dedicated UI Development track) and 3 progressive phases, focusing on building agent capabilities and user interfaces incrementally while maintaining integration across all aspects of the agent's functionality.

## 2. Project Vision

### Purpose
TAAT Agent will autonomously monitor selected trader accounts on X (Twitter), identify trade signals from natural language posts, evaluate them against user preferences, execute matching trades in the user's brokerage account with appropriate human oversight, and continuously learn from outcomes to improve performance.

### Key Differentiators
- Contextual understanding of trade signals beyond simple pattern matching
- Adaptive learning from trade outcomes and user feedback
- Personalization to individual user preferences and risk tolerance
- Transparent reasoning and explanation of trade decisions
- Collaborative decision-making with configurable autonomy levels
- Intuitive and responsive user interface for seamless interaction

## 3. Implementation Approach

## 14. Reuse Potential Between TAAT and Mentor

As noted, there is significant overlap between TAAT and Mentor capabilities, suggesting high potential for code reuse while maintaining them as separate product offerings:

### Shared Components:
- Core agent architecture and LLM integration
- Memory systems (episodic, semantic, procedural)
- Cognitive framework (reflection, meta-cognition, mental modeling)
- Learning systems and adaptation mechanisms
- Human-agent collaboration interfaces
- UI component library and design system
- Authentication and user management

### Product-Specific Components:
- Domain-specific knowledge and reasoning
- Specialized perception systems for different data sources
- Custom action mechanisms for different use cases
- Tailored user interfaces and interaction patterns
- Domain-specific visualizations and dashboards

## 15. Conclusion

This updated implementation plan provides a structured approach to developing TAAT as an AI Agent with a comprehensive user interface using the agent-oriented iAI Framework. With the completion of Workstream 1 (Agent Foundation), we have established the core architecture that will support all other capabilities.

The addition of a dedicated UI Development workstream ensures that the user interface receives appropriate attention throughout the development process, resulting in a cohesive, user-friendly application that effectively exposes the agent's capabilities to users.

The next steps focus on UI/UX design and planning, followed by implementing Phase 1 capabilities across all remaining workstreams to create a minimally viable agent with a functional user interface. This will be followed by progressive enhancement through Phases 2 and 3, resulting in a sophisticated trading assistant with an intuitive, responsive user interface.
