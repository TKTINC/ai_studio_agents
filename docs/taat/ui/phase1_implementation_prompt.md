# TAAT UI Phase 1 Implementation Prompt

## 1. Introduction

This document serves as the implementation prompt for Phase 1 of the TAAT UI development. Following the iAI framework, this prompt defines the objectives, requirements, and approach for the initial implementation phase of the TAAT user interface, building upon the comprehensive UI/UX design foundation that has been established.

## 2. Phase 1 Objectives

The primary objectives for Phase 1 implementation are:

1. Establish the technical foundation for the TAAT UI
2. Implement the core component library based on the design system
3. Create the basic application structure and navigation
4. Develop authentication and user management functionality
5. Establish the API service layer for integration with the agent core
6. Implement the dashboard with essential widgets

## 3. Requirements

### 3.1 Technical Setup

- Initialize a React application with TypeScript using Vite
- Configure ESLint, Prettier, and other development tools
- Set up the project structure according to the technical implementation approach
- Implement the routing system using React Router
- Configure the state management foundation using Redux Toolkit
- Establish the theming system based on the visual design system

### 3.2 Core Component Library

Implement the following components from the design system:

- **Core Components**
  - Button (Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, Icon)
  - Input fields (Text, Number, Select, Checkbox, Radio, Toggle)
  - Cards (Standard, Signal, Dashboard Widget)
  - Navigation elements (Top Bar, Side Navigation, Tab Bar)
  - Typography components (Headings, Body, Caption)
  - Layout components (Container, Grid, Flex)

- **Specialized Components**
  - Basic data visualization components (Charts, Tables)
  - Signal indicators
  - Price displays
  - Status indicators
  - Notifications (Toast, Alert, Badge)

### 3.3 Application Structure

- Implement the main layout with responsive behavior
- Create the navigation system (desktop and mobile)
- Set up route configuration for all main sections
- Implement authentication guards for protected routes
- Create placeholder pages for all main sections

### 3.4 Authentication and User Management

- Implement login and registration forms
- Create the authentication flow (login, logout, session management)
- Develop the user profile management interface
- Implement basic account settings
- Create the onboarding flow for new users

### 3.5 API Service Layer

- Establish the API client with Axios
- Implement authentication token management
- Create service abstractions for all main data entities
- Set up error handling and loading states
- Implement mock services for development

### 3.6 Dashboard Implementation

- Create the dashboard layout with widget grid
- Implement the following dashboard widgets:
  - Signal Feed
  - Portfolio Summary
  - Performance Metrics
  - Recent Activity
  - Market Overview

## 4. Technical Approach

### 4.1 Development Methodology

- Follow a component-driven development approach
- Develop components in isolation using Storybook
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Implement unit tests for all components and services
- Follow the BEM naming convention for CSS

### 4.2 Responsive Design Implementation

- Implement mobile-first responsive design
- Use CSS Grid and Flexbox for layouts
- Implement responsive breakpoints as defined in the design system
- Create device-specific components when necessary

### 4.3 Accessibility Implementation

- Follow WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Implement keyboard navigation
- Ensure proper contrast ratios
- Add ARIA attributes where necessary

### 4.4 Performance Considerations

- Implement code splitting for routes
- Optimize bundle size
- Use React.memo and useMemo for performance optimization
- Implement lazy loading for non-critical components

## 5. Integration with Agent Core

- Define the API contract for Phase 1 functionality
- Implement service interfaces for agent integration
- Create mock data for development and testing
- Establish WebSocket connection for real-time updates

## 6. Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for all components and utilities
- Integration tests for key user flows
- Accessibility testing
- Cross-browser testing
- Responsive testing on multiple device sizes

## 7. Documentation Requirements

- Component documentation in Storybook
- API documentation for services
- Code documentation with JSDoc
- User documentation for implemented features

## 8. Deliverables

The following deliverables are expected for Phase 1:

1. Functional React application with TypeScript
2. Core component library implemented and documented in Storybook
3. Authentication and user management functionality
4. Dashboard with essential widgets
5. API service layer with mock data
6. Comprehensive test suite
7. Technical documentation

## 9. Implementation Timeline

Phase 1 implementation is scheduled for Weeks 1-2 of the UI development track:

- **Week 1**
  - Technical setup and project configuration
  - Core component library implementation
  - Application structure and navigation

- **Week 2**
  - Authentication and user management
  - API service layer
  - Dashboard implementation
  - Testing and documentation

## 10. Success Criteria

Phase 1 implementation will be considered successful when:

1. All required components are implemented according to the design system
2. The application structure and navigation work on all target devices
3. Users can register, log in, and manage their profiles
4. The dashboard displays all required widgets with mock data
5. All tests pass and meet the coverage requirements
6. Documentation is complete and accurate

## 11. Next Steps

Upon completion of Phase 1, the implementation response document will be created to detail the actual implementation, any deviations from the plan, challenges encountered, and lessons learned. This will be followed by a review with stakeholders before proceeding to Phase 2 implementation.

This implementation prompt serves as the guiding document for Phase 1 of the TAAT UI development. It ensures alignment with the iAI framework by clearly defining the requirements, approach, and deliverables before implementation begins.
