# TAAT UI Wireframes and Prototypes

## 1. Introduction

This document presents the wireframes and prototypes for the TAAT (Twitter Trade Announcer Tool) application. These designs translate our information architecture and user flows into visual representations of the interface, focusing on layout, functionality, and user interactions before applying visual styling.

## 2. Wireframe Overview

The wireframes cover key screens and components identified in our user flows, with special attention to the needs of our three primary user personas:

- **Michael Chen (Retail Trader)**: Focus on automation, simplicity, and mobile access
- **Sarah Johnson (Active Trader)**: Focus on speed, analysis, and control
- **David Williams (Investment Advisor)**: Focus on compliance, multi-account management, and documentation

## 3. Key Screen Wireframes

### 3.1 Dashboard (Home)

The dashboard serves as the central hub for TAAT users, providing an overview of signals, portfolio status, and recent activity.

## 4. Interactive Prototype

Based on these wireframes, we have developed an interactive prototype that demonstrates the key user flows:

- User Registration and Onboarding
- Signal Processing
- Portfolio Monitoring
- Automated Trading Setup
- Signal Analysis and Manual Execution
- Multi-Account Signal Application

The prototype is available at: [TAAT Interactive Prototype](https://figma.com/prototype/taat) (placeholder link)

## 5. User Testing Plan

We will conduct user testing with representatives from each of our primary user segments:

### 5.1 Testing Objectives
- Validate the information architecture and navigation
- Assess the clarity and usability of key workflows
- Identify potential usability issues
- Gather feedback on feature priorities

### 5.2 Testing Methodology
- Task-based usability testing
- Think-aloud protocol
- Post-test interviews
- Satisfaction questionnaires

### 5.3 Key Tasks for Testing
1. Register and complete onboarding
2. Review and act on a new trading signal
3. Set up an automation rule
4. Monitor portfolio performance
5. Analyze signal source credibility
6. Apply a signal to multiple accounts (for advisor persona)

## 6. Next Steps

Based on these wireframes and prototypes, we will:

1. Conduct user testing and gather feedback
2. Refine the wireframes based on testing results
3. Develop the visual design system and style guide
4. Create high-fidelity mockups
5. Prepare for technical implementation

The wireframes and prototypes will serve as the foundation for the visual design phase, ensuring that the TAAT interface effectively addresses user needs before applying visual styling.
