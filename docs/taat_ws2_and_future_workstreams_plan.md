# TAAT WS-2 Implementation Plan & Future Agent Workstreams

## TAAT Workstream 2 (WS-2) Implementation Plan

### Overview
With the successful migration of TAAT to the AI Studio Agents monorepo, we are now ready to begin Workstream 2 (WS-2) implementation. WS-2 focuses on enhancing TAAT's capabilities with advanced memory systems and learning capabilities.

2. **Semantic Memory**
   - Knowledge base integration
   - Market terminology understanding
   - Trading pattern recognition

3. **Procedural Memory**
   - Trading procedure automation
   - Routine task optimization
   - Action sequence learning

#### Learning Systems Implementation
1. **Reinforcement Learning**
   - Feedback processing mechanisms
   - Action-reward association
